        Take it slow, tell me all how you've grown<br>
        Just for me, could we all reminisce?<br>
        Better yet, here's a pen, make a list<br>
        Fill it full with all the things I've missed<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        'Cause I can barely drive past the school without stopping to think of you<br>
        And how we used to act the fool<br>
        But worst of all, I wish I'd called at least a thousand times or more<br>
        Just to hear what I've been missing<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        If a picture is all that I have<br>
        I can picture the times that we won't get back<br>
        If I picture it now, it don't seem so bad<br>
        Either way, I still wish you were here<br>
        Don't say everything's meant to be<br>
        'Cause you know it's not what I believe<br>
        Can't help but think that it should've been me<br>
        Either way, I still wish you were here<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Thinking back on the days where we all used to say<br>
        "I know anywhere's better than here"<br>
        In the back of the class where we grew up too fast<br>
        Living life like there's nothin' to fear<br>
        But the ice on the road, driving home all alone<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Singing along to a song from three summers ago<br>
        The one that made you remember it<br>
        Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)<br>
        As the song that your life ended with<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        If a picture is all that I have<br>
        I can picture the times that we won't get back<br>
        If I picture it now, it don't seem so bad<br>
        Either way, I still wish you were here<br>
        Don't say everything's meant to be<br>
        'Cause you know it's not what I believe<br>
        Can't help but think that it should've been me<br>
        Either way, I still wish you were here<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        And they say you're in a better place (they say you're in a better place)<br>
        But a better place is right here with me<br>
        Yeah, they say you're in a better place (they say you're in a better place)<br>
        Too bad it's not what I believe<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        'Cause a picture is all that I have<br>
        To remind me that you're never comin' back<br>
        If I picture it now it just makes me sad<br>
        And right now I just wish you were here<br>
        Don't say everything's meant to be<br>
        'Cause you know it's not what I believe<br>
        Can't help but think that it should've been me<br>
        In the end, I just wish you were here<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Yeah, they say you're in a better place (they say you're in a better place)<br>
        Either way, I still wish you were here<br>
        Don't say you're in a better place (they say you're in a better place)<br>
        In the end, I just wish you were here<br>
